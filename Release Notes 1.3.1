                                  Release Notes 1.3.1

Changes introduced by version 1.3.1

- Automatic picture location estimation recomputes speed profile and does pause detection
	before location estimation to avoid pause detection based on out-dated speed profiles
	that originate when pause threshold speed limit is changed.
- A confirmation dialog now guards clearing the Collection against unwanted selection
- Removes the bug that prevented the closing dialogue from executing under Windows
- Removes the bug that prevented the presentation of the floating  menu of a course
	resulting from a split course operation
- Removes the bug that persisted in showing pictures attached to discarded documents, 
	activities or courses after they were discarded or unregistered from the database
- All sports related data is now loaded at start time and no longer on demand when
	documents were loaded.
	Consolidation no longer may compute incorrect speed values and pauses from unsynchronized
	current values. 
- Progress dialogue shows messages in the title instead of in the body of the dialogue
- Progress dialogue messages extended

							PLEASE NOTE
							===========
 					Untrusted self-signed certificates
 					
Some map providers issue self-signed certificates that are untrusted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
although they may be accepted by browsers.
This generates a connection to SSL Services failure and shows the following phrase on TrackIt's log
 
								"PKIX Path Building Failed"
								
This should usually happen with map providers
		korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de
		opentopomap.org
			
The cure is to install the certificate on the JVM. For this

First, make sure that your JVM certificate store needs updating. Try the following

1. Download Java class SSLPOKE from 
  https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/files/779355358/779355357/1/1441897666313/SSLPoke.class
2. Run it from the command line
  			java SSLPOKE <server> 443
  where <server> is the suspected server (eg: opentopomap.org)
3. It the certificate is installed you get the message
  			Successfully connected
  and need no further steps.
  However, expect it to fail because it is almost certain that a proper certificate is not installed.
  
Follow the steps below to install the certificate 

1. Obtain the certificate. Issue the following command from the command line
			openssl s_client -connect <server>:443
  where <server> is the server name (eg: opentopomap.org)
2. A section of the output from the command should show lines beginning at 
			-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  and ending at 
			-----END CERTIFICATE-----
3. Open a text file and save to it all lines between the two lines above, INCLUDING the two lines.
   Save the file as certificate.crt (or any other name, if you like)
4. From the command line run
			<JAVA_HOME>/bin/keytool -import -alias <server> -keystore <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file certificate.crt
  (where <JAVA_HOME> is your Java installation home directory)
  and you are done installing the missing certificate.
